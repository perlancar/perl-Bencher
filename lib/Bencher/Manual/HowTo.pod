=head1 TOPIC: RUNNER

=head2 Picking a runner

By default, L<bencher> runs the benchmark with L<Dumbbench> which has the
advantages like fewer required iterations or outliers exclusion. However, you
can also use the core module L<Benchmark> (Benchmark.pm) as the runner. To
select a runner:

 % bencher -m Scenario --runner Benchmark       ;# select Benchmark.pm
 % bencher -m Scenario --runner Benchmark::Dumb ;# select Dumbbench, the default

If you want to use the default Dumbbench runner, but want to format the result
like Benchmark.pm, use the C<--render-as-benchmark-pm> option (since 1.056):

 % bencher -m Scenario --render-as-benchmark-pm
