0.46.1  2016-03-31  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [dist] Forgot to bump prereq version Bencher::Backend 0.46. UPDATE:
          this version number is broken because 0.46 > 0.46.1 because 0.46
          normalizes to 0.460.000 while 0.46.1 is 0.046.100. This has happened a
          few times to me in other distributions too, so perhaps it's time to
          consider switching to a 3-digit minor version.

        - CLI script: Include description from Bencher::Backend.

	  part of developing support for benchmarking against multiple
	  perls/module versions).

	- Add option --noreturn-meta to disable returning extra metadata.

	- Add action: show-items-codes.


0.37    2016-03-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

0.36    2016-03-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Reorder formatters to avoid division by zero ('rates'
	  field removed by ModuleStartup formatter).

	- Add option: --sort.

	- Add result field: vs_slowest to compare items more easily.

	- Scenarios often use 'precision' property instead of
	  'default_precision', so let's accept that too.

	- [formatter] Don't delete constant columns if there are less than
	  two rows in result.

	- Replace POSIX::round() with sprintf(%d) because older version of
	  POSIX doesn't have round().

	- Move executing before_bench hook before testing code (which is
	  the first time we run the codes).


0.33    2016-01-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add option: --note.


0.32    2016-01-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  times).

	- [Bugfix] bencher-fmt was broken by recent changes.


0.30    2016-01-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [internal][refactor] Modularize formatting process into formatter
          modules & roles.

        - Tweak formatted result ('seq' field is by default removed, unit is now
          moved to header to keep the time fields as pure numbers).


0.29    2016-01-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Remove notes column in results table when there are no
	  notes.


0.28    2016-01-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Fix for on_result_failure='warn', forgot to remove 'next'
          statement, derp.

        - Add example scenarios: Example::MultipleArgValues::Array &
          Example::MultipleArgValues::Hash.

        - Instead of just adding item's "name" (which was convoluted
          JSON-encoded string) to the result, we now add permutation keys from
          the item, e.g. "participant", "dataset", and other permutations.
          Including each multiple argument value permutation (run included
          scenario Example::MultipleArgValues::Array for a demonstration). This
          makes for a more readable result table. As well as a more useful
          results data as we can later more easily filter/re-sort the results.

        - As an added human readability aid, when formatting result as text
          table, we now remove item permutation columns that are constant, to
          reduce clutter. For example, if you are benchmarking only a single
          dataset, the "dataset" column will be omitted from display because we
          know it only contains the same value. The JSON result will still
          contain the complete columns though.

        - In dataset's "args" property, multiple-valued argument can now be hash
          as an alternative to array. This makes for a more readable result
          because we use the hash keys as the permutation key instead of value
          (which might be long or less unreadable to human).


0.27    2016-01-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add on_result_failure.

	  before_list_datasets, before_list_participants.


0.24    2016-01-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Also add binmode(utf8) to bencher-fmt because it might print
	  the Greek Mu letter.

	- bencher-fmt: Avoid JSON decoding error warning cmdline is
	  'bencher-fmt FILENAME' when perisga-argv tries to decode FILENAME
	  as JSON first.

	  property.

          as some other modules used e.g. Benchmark::Dumb,
          Devel::Platform::Info).

0.11    2015-11-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [refactor] Move backend code from bin/bencher to lib/Bencher.pm so
